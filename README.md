# Multimodal_Paint

Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or another medium to a solid surface. The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other 
implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. In the recent years, by the improvement of electrical gadgets, many people tend to use  Graphics tablets for drawing. In addition, in the recent years, there are an upward trend in usage of leap motion and gesture control techniques for the painting purposes. In this project an attempt is made to make a multimodal system for painting. Here we use gesture control and voice recognition as the sources of human interactions with  the system. This project is about distinguishing the color of an object among the predefined colors through voice and mapping the motion into the paint. It means the user doesnâ€™t need to pick a color up by hand but by calling a color and the system understand that then searches the screen through webcam installed on computer and finds the right colored object which has been called and tracks the motion of that color and draws corresponding movement on the paint software of windows. 

* To clear the screen the user must push the 'X' button.
* To put the system in listen mode, the user must push the 'z' button.
